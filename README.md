# Node-Weather-App
A Weather app made in Node.js using Google Maps API and Dark Sky API

<br/>

Perform the steps below before running the app:

1. Get a Dark Sky API KEY from <a>https://darksky.net/dev</a>
2. create a file in root folder called .env
3. insert your API KEY in the file in the format API_KEY= YOUR_API_KEY

<br/>
<br/>

There are two app files in the project - [app.js](app.js) and [app-promise.js](app-promise.js)
Both the files perform the same task only difference is that app.js uses Callbacks where as app-promise.js uses Promise.
